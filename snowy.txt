Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village, though; 
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.


There's a patch of old snow in a corner
That I should have guessed
Was a blow-away paper the rain
Had brought to rest.

It is speckled with grime as if
Small print overspread it,
The news of a day I've forgotten
If I ever read it.

A snowy morning
by myself,
chewing on dried salmon.

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;

And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter

Of the January sun; and not to think 
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
In the sound of a few leaves,

Which is the sound of the land
Full of the same wind
That is blowing in the same bare place
For the listener, who listens in the snow,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. 

Today we woke up to a revolution of snow,
its white flag waving over everything,
the landscape vanished,
not a single mouse to punctuate the blankness,
and beyond these windows

the government buildings smothered,
schools and libraries buried, the post office lost
under the noiseless drift,
the paths of trains softly blocked,
the world fallen under this falling.

In a while I will put on some boots
and step out like someone walking in water,
and the dog will porpoise through the drifts,
and I will shake a laden branch,
sending a cold shower down on us both.

But for now I am a willing prisoner in this house,
a sympathizer with the anarchic cause of snow.
I will make a pot of tea
and listen to the plastic radio on the counter,
as glad as anyone to hear the news

that the Kiddie Corner School is closed,
the Ding-Dong School, closed,
the All Aboard Children's School, closed,
the Hi-Ho Nursery School, closed,
along with - some will be delighted to hear - 

the Toadstool School, the Little School,
Little Sparrows Nursery School,
Little Stars Pre-School, Peas-and-Carrots Day School,
the Tom Thumb Child Center, all closed,
and - clap your hands - the Peanuts Play School.

So this is where the children hide all day,
These are the nests where they letter and draw,
where they put on their bright miniature jackets,
all darting and climbing and sliding,
all but the few girls whispering by the fence.

And now I am listening hard
in the grandiose silence of the snow,
trying to hear what those three girls are plotting,
what riot is afoot,
which small queen is about to be brought down



The room was suddenly rich and the great baywindow was
Spawning snow and pink roses against it
Soundlessly collateral and incompatible
World is suddener than we fancy it.

World is crazier and more of it than we think,
Incorrigibly plural. I peel and portion
A tangerine and spit the pips and feel
The drunkenness of things being various.

And the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world
Is more spiteful and gay than one supposes
On the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of your hands
There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses. 


No hawk hangs over in this air
The urgent snow is everywhere.
The wing adroiter than a sail
Must lean away from such a gale,
Abandoning its straight intent,
Or else expose tough ligament
And tender flesh to what before
Meant dampened feathers, nothing more.
Forceless upon our backs there fall
Infrequent flakes hexagonal,
Devised in many a curious style
To charm our safety for a while,
Where close to earth like mice we go
Under the horizontal snow.

No breath of wind,
No gleam of sun
Still the white snow
Whirls softly down
Twig and bough
And blade and thorn
All in an icy
Quiet, forlorn.
Whispering, rustling,
Through the air
On still and stone,
Roof,everywhere,
It heaps its powdery
Crystal flakes,
Of every tree
A mountain makes;
‘Til pale and faint
At shut of day
Stoops from the West
One wint’ry ray,
And, feathered in fire
Where ghosts the moon,
A robin shrills
His lonely tune.

Who affirms that crystals are alive?
I affirm it, let who will deny:
Crystals are engendered, wax and thrive,
Wane and wither; I have seen them die.

Trust me, masters, crystals have their day,
Eager to attain the perfect norm,
Lit with purpose, potent to display
Facet, angle, colour, beauty, form.

Water-crystals need for flower and root
Sixty clear degrees, no less, no more
Snow, so fickle, still in this acute
Angle thinks, and learns no other lore:

Such its life, and such its pleasure is,
Such its art and traffic, such its gain,
Evermore in new conjunctions this
Admirable angle to maintain.

Crystalcraft in every flower and flake
Snow exhibits, of the welkin free:
Crystalline are crystals for the sake,
All and singular, of crystalry.

Yet does every crystal of the snow
Individualize, a seedling sown
Broadcast, but instinct with power to grow
Beautiful in beauty of its own.

Every flake with all its prongs and dints
Burns ecstatic as a new-lit star
Men are not more diverse, finger prints
More dissimilar than snow-flakes are.

Worlds of men and snow endure, increase,
Woven of power and passion to defy
Time and travail: only races cease,
Individual men and crystals die.

Its Snowing in our Town today
kids are hoping for long delay
the clouds are moving very fast
and the snow is moving in at last.

I love to watch snow fall down
as the ground covers all around.
I can't wait for Christmas to Arrive
as the love of snow comes in time.

Snow, Snow for ever more
Winter is here and here for a while.
I'm so exited to see the Snow and now
I'm going to watch it soar.

Snowstorms! 
Piles of snow! 
Soft, crystalline white snowflakes! 
Feathered rain! 
Powder snow! 
Falling snow! 
Up to the kneecaps snow! 
Snow stuck on sidewalks and streets! 
Snowballs! 
Snowmen! 
Snowdrift! 
Sledding on soft snow! 
Crunching snow! 
Snow cones!


When we were nine or ten and used to play
at dying - hands clasped to the chest,
Goodbye, beautiful world, I love you !
we didn't believe it could ever really be done.

Say goodbye to everything? A gunshot wound
In 'Alias Smith and Jones' could set us thinking
please please don't die - or a feathered mess
that had been a pigeon squashed on the road

Even divinity class, that final sponge of vinegar
on a speartip. Goodbye, beautiful vinegar.
Now, under the shag of decades, after so much
contact with things, it takes a morning like this.

Snow has fallen, a light crust. On the white field
green trails zigzag where the horses wandered,
a crazy scribble shows where they fed.
There they are now, two statues stooping.

All the ewes are sitting, thawing their grass.
Puddles punch like caramel. Little snowfalls
crumble down a hedge. The silverbirch
trembles in its own twigs shadows.

Under the rusty chestnut I walk
through a rain of crystals. There isn't much to say.
This is a day that decides by itself to be beautiful.
This field is a bride. How are we to say goodbye?

The winter comes silently
In the night to blanket God's creation.
Awaking to the splendor of a winter 
Morn is breathtaking, 
Its hushed beauty  enchanting.
The sun peeps out from the gray sky, 
Creating a scene that sparkles with diamonds.
Crabapples  dried up - prunelike, 
Blanketed with heavenly white, 
Laden down, hiding their features
Under tiny puffs of frigid, thick cotton.
The little greek maiden on the lawn
Wears a pillbox hat of ermine in olden style, 
As she overlooks the pool for fish. 
Chairs left out from warmer days
Are adorned with fluffy, white pillows  so inviting.
A hazy gray like film envelopes the atmosphere making it
The thing from which dreams are made.

Mystic midnight snow
Flows quietly 'ore the stream
Sleigh ride for snow nymphs

She loves me, she
Loves me not, 
Petal by plucked petal.
She loves me, 
She loves me not, 
Idly drifting, unmettled, 
Into the blue as forget-me-not.
Petals idly scenting
The frost-shattered and
Febrile earth, 
Crushed and lying, 
Bruised and torn, 
Somewhat… dissipated.
For what is a flowerless
Flower but naked
In the cowl of winter’s bitter
Tears?


snow
white specks of mystery
a language within a language
a word within a word
a language not spoken
cry
my dear child cry
let it go
let it fly away
above the mountain tops
cry my dear child cry
and let it snow
my dear Malachi


it blows a snowing gale in the winter of the year;
The boats are on the sea and the crews are on the pier.
The needle of the vane, it is veering to and fro,
A flash of sun is on the veering of the vane.
Autumn leaves and rain,
The passion of the gale.
