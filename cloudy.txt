I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers, 
From the seas and the streams; 
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid 
In their noonday dreams. 
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken 
The sweet buds every one, 
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast, 
As she dances about the sun. 
I wield the flail of the lashing hail, 
And whiten the green plains under, 
And then again I dissolve it in rain, 
And laugh as I pass in thunder. 

I sift the snow on the mountains below, 
And their great pines groan aghast; 
And all the night 'tis my pillow white, 
While I sleep in the arms of the blast. 
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers, 
Lightning my pilot sits; 
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder, 
It struggles and howls at fits; 
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion, 
This pilot is guiding me, 
Lured by the love of the genii that move 
In the depths of the purple sea; 
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills, 
Over the lakes and the plains, 
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream, 
The Spirit he loves remains; 
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile, 
Whilst he is dissolving in rains. 

The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes, 
And his burning plumes outspread, 
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack, 
When the morning star shines dead; 
As on the jag of a mountain crag, 
Which an earthquake rocks and swings, 
An eagle alit one moment may sit 
In the light of its golden wings. 
And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath, 
Its ardours of rest and of love, 
And the crimson pall of eve may fall 
From the depth of Heaven above, 
With wings folded I rest, on mine aëry nest, 
As still as a brooding dove. 

That orbèd maiden with white fire laden, 
Whom mortals call the Moon, 
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor, 
By the midnight breezes strewn; 
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet, 
Which only the angels hear, 
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof, 
The stars peep behind her and peer; 
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee, 
Like a swarm of golden bees, 
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent, 
Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas, 
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high, 
Are each paved with the moon and these. 

I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone, 
And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl; 
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim, 
When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl. 
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape, 
Over a torrent sea, 
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof, 
The mountains its columns be. 
The triumphal arch through which I march 
With hurricane, fire, and snow, 
When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair, 
Is the million-coloured bow; 
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove, 
While the moist Earth was laughing below. 

I am the daughter of Earth and Water, 
And the nursling of the Sky; 
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores; 
I change, but I cannot die. 
For after the rain when with never a stain 
The pavilion of Heaven is bare, 
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams 
Build up the blue dome of air, 
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph, 
And out of the caverns of rain, 
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb, 
I arise and unbuild it again.

White sheep, white sheep,
On a blue hill,
When the wind stops,
You all stand still.
When the wind blows,
You walk away slow.
White sheep, white sheep,
Where do you go?

Up above me;
A cloudless sky
In my hand,
Clouded liquor
In my mind
A clouded mess
That's becoming clearer
With each sip I take

When dark clouds appear
All I want are friendly rains
But a strange storm came.

A cloud in the sky
Unassuming, lost and dry
It wandered and died.

Today’s cloud is a rainbow
Dark blue
Light blue
Orange 
Pink 
With white
Outlines

Some clouds are Pentecostal fury
Orange cotton burning 
With daylight’s rage
Swirling and smoking 
Working themselves 
Up into a storm of retribution

The clouds descend
Bluish grey beasts 
Swallowing
The skies
Consuming 
All things in sight
Leaving nothing
But a lone tree
To stand against
The rain and sleet

Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-
"We play from the time we wake till the day ends.
We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon."
I ask, "But how am I to get up to you ?"
They answer, "Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your
hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds."
"My mother is waiting for me at home, "I say, "How can I leave
her and come?"
Then they smile and float away.
But I know a nicer game than that, mother.
I shall be the cloud and you the moon.
I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will
be the blue sky.
The folk who live in the waves call out to me-
"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know
not where we pass."
I ask, "But how am I to join you?"
They tell me, "Come to the edge of the shore and stand with
your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves."
I say, "My mother always wants me at home in the everything-
how can I leave her and go?"
They smile, dance and pass by.
But I know a better game than that.
I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.
I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with
laughter.
And no one in the world will know where we both are. 



The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go.

A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem

Whenever the clouds of pain and sadness loomed,
Whenever tears came till the eyelashes,
Whenever this lonely heart got scared,
I told my heart, Oh Heart, why do you cry?
This is what happens in this world…

This deep silence…the world has distributed it to everyone,
Some sadness is a part of everyone's life,
Some sunshine is a part of everyone's life,
Your eyes are wet without any reason,
Every second is a new season,
Why do you let go of such priceless moments?
Oh Heart, why do you cry? 

My father and mother, two tiny figures,
side by side, facing the clouds that move
in from the Atlantic. August, '33.
The whole weight of the rain to come, the weight
of all that has fallen on their houses
gathers for a last onslaught, and yet they
hold, side by side, in the eye of memory.
What was she wearing, you ask, what did he
say to make the riding clouds hold their breath?
Our late August afternoons were chilly
in America, so I shall drape her throat
in a silken scarf above a black dress.

I could give her a rope of genuine pearls
as a gift for bearing my father's sons,
and let each pearl glow with a child's fire.
I could turn her toward you now with a smile
so that we might joy in her constancy,
I could bury the past in dust rising,
dense rain falling, and the absence of sky
so that you could turn this page and smile.
My father and mother, two tiny figures,
side by side, facing the clouds that move
in from the Atlantic. They are silent
under the whole weight of the rain to come.

White clouds 
Morphing wonderfully 
Watch those bears 
Changing into 
Rows of elephants 
Shaping like 
A frail old man standing 
Rearranging into children 
Playing with balloons. 

White clouds 
Sway on cradle of the wind 
Occasionally shrivel 
With toil and sadness 
At times inflate 
With joy and gladness 
Never forget 
Heaven nor earth 
They lie pendent 
Between the two worlds. 

White clouds 
Strolling since eternity 
Telling strange fables 
Of grand olden dwellings 
With a world of ancient souls 
When there was nothing, but 
A fluid of light, 
A landscape of mist 
And a suspended caravan 
Of several ages. 

White clouds, now 
Moulding into sombre faces, become 
Storms sulking on the horizon. 
Thousands of maladies thrive 
Above and underneath the land. 
White clouds 
Course through hearts, 
Surging in 
The plasma flow of vessels. 

i use to
love a
girl who
wore
a necklace
of clouds

and since
she was almost always
of a
sunny disposition
mostly they'd be pure
and white

but sometimes on
her becoming
sad
they
would rain

or sometimes
she'd become
angry and they'd
storm
which she didn't like
being girlishly vain
because
the lighting would strike
her skin
leaving scars

but
there was one time
i saw them snow

the time
i told her
i cheated on her
with her best friend

and they snowed
and snowed 
and snowed
and snowed
until it covered
her up and she died
from exposure

and after she died
since she never told
anyone i cheated on her
her family gave the necklace
of clouds to me

and i put it on 
and it snowed
and snowed
and snowed
and snowed
until i died from
exposure
too

so now
when you
approach me
you will see
that coldness
in my eyes
and that cloud
of frost when i
speak

because
no longer is there
any warmth
in my body
to thaw my breath

because
my
heart is
frozen

The clouds as I see them, rising 
urgently, roseate in the 
mounting of somber power 


surging in evening haste over 
roofs and hermetic 
grim walls— 


Last night 
As if death had lit a pale light 
in your flesh, your flesh 
was cold to my touch, or not cold 
but cool, cooling, as if the last traces 
of warmth were still fading in you. 
My thigh burned in cold fear where 
yours touched it. 


But I forced to mind my vision of a sky 
close and enclosed, unlike the space in which these clouds move— 
a sky of gray mist it appeared— 
and how looking intently at it we saw 
its gray was not gray but a milky white 
in which radiant traces of opal greens, 
fiery blues, gleamed, faded, gleamed again, 
and how only then, seeing the color in the gray, 
a field sprang into sight, extending 
between where we stood and the horizon, 


a field of freshest deep spiring grass 
starred with dandelions, 
green and gold 
gold and green alternating in closewoven 
chords, madrigal field. 


Is death’s chill that visited our bed 
other than what it seemed, is it 
a gray to be watched keenly? 


Wiping my glasses and leaning westward, 
clearing my mind of the day’s mist and leaning 
into myself to see 
the colors of truth 


I watch the clouds as I see them 
in pomp advancing, pursuing 
the fallen sun.

The clouds passing by
Carried my past in silence
To another time

Curly clouds of snowy white, 
Fleecy islands in the light, 
Prettier than cotton wool, 
Come and be my bed tonight.

Even a king would not disdain
Golden cloud for counterpane, 
White ones for the sheets so cool
Pillows like a silken skein! 

Oh! To sleep and dream, and wake
With the cloud's first morning shake, 
Hear the broad Earth stir below, 
Watch the shinning daylight break! 

Lying safe upon my cloud, 
Feeling like a fairy proud, 
Sailing softly I should go, 
Singing like the larks aloud!

Like soft white carpet
On the blue floor of Heaven
Clouds are spread splendidly

When I look out of my open window
And behold the clouds leisurely drifting away
I am reminded of the days that held with me a tryst
And has now drifted into the far beyond with the gust.

Some days were bright and inviting like white cotton clouds
Others were gloomy and ominous like their somber cousins-
Some rumbled and thundered and rained copious tears 
And lo, ushered in a bright day to appreciate and cheer!


Golden clouds had passed, 
As rain in a distant land, 
Grass here withered dry.


Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass, 
Of glory in the flower, 
We will grieve not; 
Rather find strength in what remains behind
William Wordsworth


It was Wordsworth who introduced me to
the verbal celebration of the glory around us: 
the miracles hidden in the dirt and rough
of fields and lawns; 
in the sparkling speckles of mica, 
sifted through stone outcroppings; 
in the fugue-like melodies tumbling out of mountain brooks
as they wend their way through forests smothered in a silence
that sings.

It was he who set out in words
a vision of who we are and from whence we came, 
who spoke of clouds of glory
floating like halos

Sun, moon, sun, moon, 
Where is the direction? 
You are betrayed, I pity you, 
Betrayed by sight, sense, touch, thoughts, 
Betrayed by yourself.

Stand, fall, Stand, fall, 
I am still clutching myself, I cant stand up, 
I pity my ego.
Betrayed by myself, my strength, 
Let me go, Let me drown

Stop, See, Stop, See, 
I cant stop, I cant see, 
I cant stand up, 
I cant let go, 
Not to live.

With no hope, I sit and stare at my helplessness, 
Clinging to my ego, my thoughts, 
With no strength in my legs, 
I have to sit,
over the infants we held in our arms.

Wordsworth felt the splendor fade, 
diminishing as he aged.

Yet when I read his words again, 
the pictures not only brighten the sky
of my burgeoning sunset, 
they waft over me a joyous soft breeze
of comfort and assurance
that when the sun sets, 
I will float back through those clouds of glory
and find myself where I began.

Waiting for clouds
Waiting for clouds
Waiting for clouds
Waiting for clouds
Waiting for clouds
Waiting for clouds
Waiting for clouds
Waiting for clouds Waiting for clouds

he thought of you
only distorts my perception.
Everything that’s real
turns to fiction.
Lost in the crowd, 
a giant sea of faces.
Never the one
i’m always longing to see.
It hurts like crazy.
I don’t know where I end
or where I start.
There was a time
where we could run away.
I wasn’t afraid of anything.
If only I didn’t loose my senses, 
when I only intended
for the most intricate words to come out right.
I love you



There’s a dark cloud overhead
As if brought by a storm
But this cloud will not shift
And more clouds begin to form

The darkness lurks above
Bringing sorrow into the air
The fog begins to appear
As my heart starts to tear

The night falls apart
In my shaking hands
Nothing can be repaired
In these despair-filled lands

I fall to my knees
And beg for happiness
As the world crumbles down
i am lost in the darkness
