Haze. Three student violists boarding 
a bus. A clatter of jackhammers. 
Granular light. A film of sweat for primer 
and the heat for a coat of paint. 
A man and a woman on a bench: 
she tells him he must be psychic, 
for how else could he sense, even before she knew, 
that she’d need to call it off? A bicyclist 
fumes by with a coach’s whistle clamped 
hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle 
on the boil. I never meant, she says. 
But I thought, he replies. Two cabs almost 
collide; someone yells fuck in Farsi. 
I’m sorry, she says. The comforts 
of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon. 
The sky blursthere’s a storm coming 
up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly 
around a corner. How familiar 
it feels to feel strange, hollower 
than a bassoon. A rill of chill air 
in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail. 


When the crimson rose has faded
And our day at last is done;
In the forest dark and shaded
Blows the tempest, dims the sun.
When the night holds us together
Shall forgiveness mend the past
Will despair bring sunny weather 
And heal our hearts at last?

If we hide within the shadows
Will you stay here close to me;
Will we walk forgotten meadows
Or sail a foreign sea?
In vain the hour must reap
What we gathered in the sun;
And love's harvest now will weep
For the battle never won.

Within the world's disgrace
In the hour of Nevermore;
Will there be another race
To a far-off fabled shore?
We promised love tomorrow
We preen with pride today
Now pride and love will borrow
The tears of yesterday.

Our pride we now confess it
Is a sin that couldn't last;
Our passion if we kiss it
Is like a dream now passed.
While fragrance scents the garden
And the misty moon rides high;
The wind whispers a pardon
When love goes passing by.

I am 
the wandering breeze in the wheat field
the pawn advancing to the eighth rank
the ocher leaves under the window
the One Hundred Years of Solitude
the One Thousand and One Nights
the disappointment of the elderly
the pile of dirty dishes in the sink
the water trickling into the sewer
the hand that calls and defends
the vast ocean that drowns me
the widower feeding the doves
the five drops of Chanel No. 5
the saddest verses of Neruda
the insect hidden in a cocoon
the impotence of forgiveness
the Tango and the Tarantella
the windmills of Don Quixote
the colors and the shadows
the sadness of the hunger
the barking dog that bites
the prelude and the fugue
the glass of wine to share
the illusion of the outcast
the puddles on the street
the new kid in the school
the orphan in the asylum
the lies of the politicians
the rain on a sunny day
the message in a bottle
the petal and the thorn
the laughter of children
the blindness of Borges
the feather in the wind
the moss on the stone
the beard of Whitman
the Nuremberg Trials
the door always open 
the underpaid worker
the mistletoe waiting
the hair in your food
the tangerine wedge
the gasp to nowhere
the last surrenderer
the beggar's refuge
the pointing finger
the foam of anger
the broken mirror
the clocks of Dali
the curving road
the Trail of Tears
the garlic breath
the bitter vomit
the Nazca lines
the lost island
the false note
the joy of sin
I am death
underwear
buccaneer
sunflower
solstice
silence
sperm
guitar
lover
gore
war 
you
we
the poet.

"I dream of Candy!"

Sweet cakes and peanut butter squares 
A living diabetic's nightmare. --  My heart 
sings to the beat, Under the Neutron Star Crunch
Sweet sugar cookies and peanut butter bars

Taunting whoopers, 
Dancing dum dum's, 
The sweetest silhouette show - in my room
Dreamy, Creamy Cupcakes in the afternoon
Cinnamon Cheerios cascade on my spoon
Sweeter than my sweet tooth
Now and later - a forever honeymoon

Jigglin' my jelly belly boo berry Butterfinger delight
I'm in love, licking the icy ICEE  all night long
Extra freshness, once I crop a top off of a mountain dew pop
My eyes sparkle like diamond dazzle razzles in the sky
i LIVE to fabricate my very own sugar extract R.E.M. Sleep
Savoring the sound of saliva trapped in my mouth
THIS night  -   ovulated buds   -  wait to feast!
Enjoying a delicious dulce music sleepy symphony

Braggin' and embracin' a pinata pillow escapade
Enchanted by a cotton candy crave - calling my name

Lalaloopsy licorice and lemonade tea
The best-wet dream I've ever seen
Marshmallows of solitude dulcify every fresh fantasy
Enticing in a bright slushy skittles daydream freeze

One fat sunny bowl of cereals and cane
Crackerjack spell ---  chocolate chip swirls, 
Caramel lumps constipate the brain
Sizing - peanuts and in a popcorn party payday
Wrigley's wild winter Spearmint Breath parade
Give me, give me, some Gummy bear Dessert  
Another Fruit Ninja hair DAY!"
Watermelon Taffy stuck on the top of my gums
Swallowing the whiteness in a whistle pop bar
I FELL LIKE A SWEET SUGAR STAR!!!

Glaze of glory erupts deep down my throat 24/7
Bubblicious, mint twist, Sunkist the best Twizzler breakfast
Yummy in my twinkie tummy, drooling over frosted flakes 
One more strawberry smoothie 44 oz cup   
Counting each and every Pez popping'' up
Goodnight light, 
It's time to get lost under the midnight moon pie sky
SELF- Huggin'' and snugglin'' to a new sugar rush high



Ink carries its own tale,
When moonshine intoxicates your pen
Bottles of ink fill your mind
Composing symphonies on every line
Drops of passion all over the mask you wear
Nothing compares to black stains and broken nails

This part of you 
"A CAN'T BE REMOVED" tattoo
The tough skin you'll ever live in
Fountain pens of split identities
Who Are You?
Sinking  words like no other
Poisoned ink piercing every rhyme
Inferior poet, making the heart pure
Anger plus anger "GIVE ME MORE!"

You have a desire to paint all day,
Breathing and beating in every way
Toxic lines, from which ink flows
Inhaling images from the world
Deep and cold sorrowed emotions 
True love is always easy to poetize
Dear Poet:  "Ink Never Lies."

Pretty pink acrostic ink when she's nearby
Sugar and salt, Epic taste of reality
Ballads sang under the full moon
Sunny Sonnets, on any rainy day
Ode's of rivers from your past
A dark smile jotting down memory lane
Monologue tears brought under pressure
Loading cartridges of fresh Senryu and Haiku"
Dramatic red runs through your veins when all is done
Unfolding old and new propaganda's
POET: You are my favorite verse in every stanza
((Only this, and nothing more))
Writing is like giving birth

Close your eyes and forget the rain
                                   Dream about the sun and heat
                                          a sunny summer day
                                       Dream of waves who sigh
                                          so quiet on the beach
                              Swimming naked with the one you love


                                       The dream of happiness
                                       is more than the dream
                           A dream about strawberries with cream on
                                Do not forget the roses and violets
                                          that smells so good
                            Running barefoot in the freshly cut grass


                            Close your eyes and dream your dreams
                                 Daydreaming as sweet and good
                      they are secret, I will not share them with anyone
                                  Imagine if life was a dream .....
                                         A wonderful dream
                                 and the world was full of love
                      and intimacy between all the people on earth
                                     My dreams are made of 
                                       hope, faith and love



My shoes have traveled miles of roads
Their soles are worn quite thin
Struggling with this heavy load
I carry deep within
Beyond repair, no longer shine
Scuffed with many stains
It's mostly been an uphill climb
Some sunny days, some rain

A little big when they were new
With ample room to grow
This green stain here on my left shoe
Was puberty's first blow
Those salt stains there, that's sweat and tears
Still damp from being heartbroken
They've darkened some throughout the years
Old wounds that were reopened

There are no stains from happy tears
I finally understood
Obviously they disappeared
Right after parenthood
All these scuff marks 'long the sides
Well they're from clumsiness
From times I fell and hurt my pride
A reminding subsequence

They've danced and skated, loved and dated
Walked a few high wires
Death devastated, been mismated
Even walked through hell's hot fires
It's said that one can tell a lot
By looking at one's shoes
Until you've worn these shoes I've got
You really have no clue

ou had just turned 13,
getting interested in girls.
When CF took you from me,
my heart, like a flag, unfurled.

You fought CF with every breath.
For 13 years you tried.
And four lung collapses later,
after each one, I said, 
"Son, you will survive."
Oh, how I lied!

Now, no more hugs and kisses,
No more birthday wishes,
I watched you go
and please God know,
Heaven, receive my treasure.

Great is the sun, and wide he goes 
Through empty heaven with repose; 
And in the blue and glowing days 
More thick than rain he showers his rays. 

Though closer still the blinds we pull 
To keep the shady parlour cool, 
Yet he will find a chink or two 
To slip his golden fingers through. 

The dusty attic spider-clad 
He, through the keyhole, maketh glad; 
And through the broken edge of tiles 
Into the laddered hayloft smiles. 

Meantime his golden face around 
He bares to all the garden ground, 
And sheds a warm and glittering look 
Among the ivy's inmost nook. 

Above the hills, along the blue, 
Round the bright air with footing true, 
To please the child, to paint the rose, 
The gardener of the World, he goes. 


Suddenly, from all the green around you,
something-you don't know what-has disappeared;
you feel it creeping closer to the window,
in total silence. From the nearby wood

you hear the urgent whistling of a plover,
reminding you of someone's Saint Jerome:
so much solitude and passion come
from that one voice, whose fierce request the downpour

will grant. The walls, with their ancient portraits, glide
away from us, cautiously, as though
they weren't supposed to hear what we are saying.

And reflected on the faded tapestries now;
the chill, uncertain sunlight of those long
childhood hours when you were so afraid.

See what delights in sylvan scenes appear! 
Descending Gods have found Elysium here. 
In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd, 
And chaste Diana haunts the forest shade. 
Come lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours, 
When swains from shearing seek their nightly bow'rs; 
When weary reapers quit the sultry field, 
And crown'd with corn, their thanks to Ceres yield. 
This harmless grove no lurking viper hides, 
But in my breast the serpent Love abides. 
Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew, 
But your Alexis knows no sweets but you. 
Oh deign to visit our forsaken seats, 
The mossy fountains, and the green retreats! 
Where-e'er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade, 
Trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade, 
Where-e'er you tread, the blushing flow'rs shall rise, 
And all things flourish where you turn your eyes. 
Oh! How I long with you to pass my days, 
Invoke the muses, and resound your praise; 
Your praise the birds shall chant in ev'ry grove, 
And winds shall waft it to the pow'rs above. 
But wou'd you sing, and rival Orpheus' strain, 
The wond'ring forests soon shou'd dance again, 
The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call, 
And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall! 
But see, the shepherds shun the noon-day heat, 
The lowing herds to murm'ring brooks retreat, 
To closer shades the panting flocks remove, 
Ye Gods! And is there no relief for Love? 
But soon the sun with milder rays descends
To the cool ocean, where his journey ends; 
On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey, 
By night he scorches, as he burns by day.

The church bells toll a melancholy round,
Calling the people to some other prayers,
Some other gloominess, more dreadful cares,
More harkening to the sermon's horrid sound.
Surely the mind of man is closely bound
In some blind spell: seeing that each one tears
Himself from fireside joys and Lydian airs,
And converse high of those with glory crowned.
Still, still they toll, and I should feel a damp,
A chill as from a tomb, did I not know
That they are dying like an outburnt lamp, - 
That 'tis their sighing, wailing, ere they go
Into oblivion -that fresh flowers will grow,
And many glories of immortal stamp.

The Oriole sings in the greening grove 
As if he were half-way waiting, 
The rosebuds peep from their hoods of green, 
Timid, and hesitating. 
The rain comes down in a torrent sweep 
And the nights smell warm and pinety, 
The garden thrives, but the tender shoots 
Are yellow-green and tiny. 
Then a flash of sun on a waiting hill, 
Streams laugh that erst were quiet, 
The sky smiles down with a dazzling blue 
And the woods run mad with riot.

My books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read, 
'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large 
Down in the meadow, where is richer feed, 
And will not mind to hit their proper targe. 

Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too, 
Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again, 
What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true, 
Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men. 

Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough, 
What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town, 
If juster battles are enacted now 
Between the ants upon this hummock's crown? 

Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn, 
If red or black the gods will favor most, 
Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn, 
Struggling to heave some rock against the host. 

Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour, 
For now I've business with this drop of dew, 
And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower-- 
I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue. 

This bed of herd's grass and wild oats was spread 
Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use. 
A clover tuft is pillow for my head, 
And violets quite overtop my shoes. 

And now the cordial clouds have shut all in, 
And gently swells the wind to say all's well; 
The scattered drops are falling fast and thin, 
Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell. 

I am well drenched upon my bed of oats; 
But see that globe come rolling down its stem, 
Now like a lonely planet there it floats, 
And now it sinks into my garment's hem. 

Drip drip the trees for all the country round, 
And richness rare distills from every bough; 
The wind alone it is makes every sound, 
Shaking down crystals on the leaves below. 

For shame the sun will never show himself, 
Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so; 
My dripping locks--they would become an elf, 
Who in a beaded coat does gayly go

Come we to the summer, to the summer we will come, 
For the woods are full of bluebells and the hedges full of bloom,
And the crow is on the oak a-building of her nest,
And love is burning diamonds in my true lover's breast;
She sits beneath the whitethorn a-plaiting of her hair,
And I will to my true lover with a fond request repair;
I will look upon her face, I will in her beauty rest,
And lay my aching weariness upon her lovely breast.

The clock-a-clay is creeping on the open bloom of May,
The merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all day,
And the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy nest
In the whitethorn bush where I will lean upon my lover's breast;
I'll lean upon her breast and I'll whisper in her ear
That I cannot get a wink o'sleep for thinking of my dear;
I hunger at my meat and I daily fade away
Like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the day. 

In the summer
I stretch out on the shore
And think of you
Had I told the sea
What I felt for you,
It would have left its shores,
Its shells,
Its fish,
And followed me.

A languid atmosphere, a lazy breeze,
With labored respiration, moves the wheat
From distant reaches, till the golden seas
Break in crisp whispers at my feet.

My book, neglected of an idle mind,
Hides for a moment from the eyes of men;
Or lightly opened by a critic wind,
Affrightedly reviews itself again.

Off through the haze that dances in the shine
The warm sun showers in the open glade,
The forest lies, a silhouette design
Dimmed through and through with shade.

A dreamy day; and tranquilly I lie
At anchor from all storms of mental strain;
With absent vision, gazing at the sky,
"Like one that hears it rain."

The Katydid, so boisterous last night,
Clinging, inverted, in uneasy poise,
Beneath a wheat-blade, has forgotten quite
If "Katy DID or DIDN'T" make a noise.

The twitter, sometimes, of a wayward bird
That checks the song abruptly at the sound,
And mildly, chiding echoes that have stirred,
Sink into silence, all the more profound.

And drowsily I hear the plaintive strain
Of some poor dove . . . Why, I can scarcely keep
My heavy eyelids--there it is again--
"Coo-coo!"--I mustn't--"Coo-coo!"--fall asleep!

n youth, it was a way I had
To do my best to please,
And change, with every passing lad,
To suit his theories.

But now I know the things I know,
And do the things I do;
And if you do not like me so,
To hell, my love, with you! 


I know I am but summer to your heart,
And not the full four seasons of the year;
And you must welcome from another part
Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear.
No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell
Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing;
And I have loved you all too long and well
To carry still the high sweet breast of Spring.
Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,
I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,
That you may hail anew the bird and rose
When I come back to you, as summer comes.
Else will you seek, at some not distant time,
Even your summer in another clime.


Through the pregnant universe rumbles life's terrific thunder, 
And Earth's bowels quake with terror; strange and terrible storms break, 
Lightning-torches flame the heavens, kindling souls of men, thereunder: 
Africa! long ages sleeping, O my motherland, awake! 

In the East the clouds glow crimson with the new dawn that is breaking, 
And its golden glory fills the western skies. 
O my brothers and my sisters, wake! arise! 
For the new birth rends the old earth and the very dead are waking, 
Ghosts are turned flesh, throwing off the grave's disguise, 
And the foolish, even children, are made wise; 
For the big earth groans in travail for the strong, new world in making-- 
O my brothers, dreaming for dim centuries, 
Wake from sleeping; to the East turn, turn your eyes! 

Oh the night is sweet for sleeping, but the shining day's for working; 
Sons of the seductive night, for your children's children's sake, 
From the deep primeval forests where the crouching leopard's lurking, 
Lift your heavy-lidded eyes, Ethiopia! awake! 

In the East the clouds glow crimson with the new dawn that is breaking, 
And its golden glory fills the western skies. 
O my brothers and my sisters, wake! arise! 
For the new birth rends the old earth and the very dead are waking, 
Ghosts have turned flesh, throwing off the grave's disguise, 
And the foolish, even children, are made wise; 
For the big earth groans in travail for the strong, new world in making-- 
O my brothers, dreaming for long centuries, 
Wake from sleeping; to the East turn, turn your eyes!

O thou who passest thro' our valleys in
Thy strength, curb thy fierce steeds, allay the heat
That flames from their large nostrils! thou, O Summer,
Oft pitched'st here thy goldent tent, and oft
Beneath our oaks hast slept, while we beheld
With joy thy ruddy limbs and flourishing hair.

Beneath our thickest shades we oft have heard
Thy voice, when noon upon his fervid car
Rode o'er the deep of heaven; beside our springs
Sit down, and in our mossy valleys, on
Some bank beside a river clear, throw thy
Silk draperies off, and rush into the stream:
Our valleys love the Summer in his pride.

Our bards are fam'd who strike the silver wire:
Our youth are bolder than the southern swains:
Our maidens fairer in the sprightly dance:
We lack not songs, nor instruments of joy,
Nor echoes sweet, nor waters clear as heaven,
Nor laurel wreaths against the sultry heat.

n winter I get up at night
And dress by yellow candle-light.
In summer quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.

I have to go to bed and see
The birds still hopping on the tree,
Or hear the grown-up people's feet
Still going past me in the street.

And does it not seem hard to you,
When all the sky is clear and blue,
And I should like so much to play,
To have to go to bed by day? 

it's good not to drink
it's good not to piss
in the sink & it's good
not to think

the clarion ring
of   a glass clinking
with ice good to hear it
fade into a past

borrowed. you paid
no dues you did
no time

but the time spent
sodden. what you thought

This is the type of weather that
clings
against your skin
and you find yourself 
wishing that No Clothing
was an acceptable and
okay this

Sometimes the weather
Is a foe you can't beat.
The library just closed
"Due to excessive heat".


Heat waves blister us
Water evaporates fast
Temperatures soar high


One hot afternoon
Trees are silent and still
The wind blows hot 
through my skin
with my eyes burning in heat
Crack and dry lips
I look at the sun

dying of heat
Wish I was dead
Wish the weather
Was all in my head

fuck this shit
I want to move
live in the northpole
im all sweaty ew 
fuck this its time to take a cold shower

Sun-blushed mugginess mothers us,
With the promise of a storm.
Swarms of bumble bees do buzz
Amongst Cotoneasters bathed in warm.

It’s proper summer,
That’s for sure.


The air has a burnt smell
It is hot and dry
The streets are  empty
Even the dogs are missing
It is a hot and bright afternoon

People have taken refuge 
under the roofs of their homes or work places
Even the trees seem to be mute
So are the birds and the cattle

My throat is dry
My mind is blank
My brain is asleep
Am struggling to keep awake

The weather is strange
The climate is changing
The ponds are dry
The brooks are dusty 
with no water to flow

The earth is moving lazy and slow
Time seem to crawling because of the heat
The noon seems to un-ending
The schools are noiseless and sleepy.

It is dusty and hazy
The only wind being because of the 
fast moving buses and trucks
and some occasional cars

The windows are closed
so do the doors of the buildings 
across the streets
The rich enjoying their siesta 
in the air conditioned rooms

The poor, sweating it out 
in their places of work
for their daily wages
so that they can have 
some food to eat in the night.

so also that
the rich can continue to have
their peaceful siestas


We have become static on the television
Ringing noises at random moments
Sore backs in cold weather
Knees that don't always bend the right way
Hair that doesn't comply to orders
Traffic jams in hot weather
Gum that has lost its flavor
The warm side of the pillow
Frayed shoe laces without purpose
We have let our lives 
Become the trivial annoyances 
The writers block accepted
Giving in to the frivolous empathy
We complain is everyday life

you ever been
cold in hot weather?
no holds barred ever? 
grown old forever?
ever wrote a red note,
blood letter?
ever eaten crow
and feathers?
ever known old scratch
in the false heathers?
you ever been
cold in hot weather?

Hot weather and humid air 
friends that love you and care 
talking all night above the covers 
eating pizza and drinking cold drinks 
           Stairs creak when it's time to go
I will miss this place 
and the memories it holds
Do I want to leave? Not really, No 
But sometimes leaving is necessary to grow

I miss the summer.
The hot weather,
The carefree atmosphere.
The smell of flowers, 
Mixed with nail polih,
And grilled chicken. 

Sunny days has come our ways
Hot weather is what everyone has been waiting for
To head to the beach and make those time memorable. 

Sunny days are the best
Because it seems to bring happiness all day
You look outside 
And all you see is brightness everywhere.

Sunny days are the times
Where you can have a drink and have fun
Make a bbq and spend time with your love ones

Sunny days are the times to take advantage 
For they only come once a year and vanish.

Been hiding don't you know
It's been a while 
since we have talked 
thought it best 
not been feeling my best 
I have been caught up 
in a new creative thing 
Called art 
painting and drawing 
for hours on end 
the time has flown.

It is nearly the end of summer
But we had some brilliant hot weather
Now it's about time i got right back 
on track.
With my Mr Ketchup stories 
and some inspiring poems  

Don't worry my friends 
I am back again 
Oh how i have missed you all 
My faithful friends and all

When summer comes
I hope the sun shines bright
I hope I have lazy days out and with friends long memorable nights

I wish for finally breaking my self crafted mold
I don't want to die old crusty and alone
I hope I can find the boldness that only hot weather and small bikinis can bring

When summer comes to Chicago
I hope my city can act right
With another Stanley Cup  hopefully! To celebrate, I hope my summer is bright

i am summer.
feel the rush of the wind against your cheeks,
and taste the arid air, suddenly interrupted by torrential downpours.

warm. wet. moist.

scintillating dewdrops in the midst of gray skies and hot weather.
fog masking our view.
coquette: her skin plump and soft, like peaches.
thin fabrics tinged with the slightest traces of sweat.
and the sweetest scent of summer.
